# js-potion-maker

In potion maker, the player must connect producers to vials via pipes. Producers make primary colours that can be combined to make more
complex colours.
The game has a dynamic difficulty - filling vials successfully / unsuccessfully affects the players performance score, which will affect
the overall difficulty of the game. As the difficulty increases, the player will have to fill larger vials with more colour variation. 



To run:
